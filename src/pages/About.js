        "Tenkatori's Accretive Sauce Recipe has been preserved for almost 70
        years. The oil is changed daily, always fresh" Our menu is simple, but
        has variations. From your standard chunks of karaage, to a whole chicken
        leg fried to perfection. You can order a meal with sides, order in bulk
        for a special occasion, or just a small snack for the drive home. In
        Japanese, “Tenka Tori “ is a double entendre. It can mean, “Peerless
        (the best) Chicken” or “Obtaining Peerlessness (the best)”. With that in
        mind it was Tenkatori Japan’s goal to provide the best karaage in Japan.
        Now we start our new quest in making the best karaage in the world.
